# Todo
Listed here are things that _need_ to or that I'd like to accomplish in this project, in no particular order

## Requirements
- Fully convert to visitor pattern for typechecking/codegen
  - Delete old implementation, from following Antlr/Kotlin blog post series
- Add tests for TreeMaker (with and without positioning)
- Add line of code to error message?
- Fully rename project from sandy -> kage
- Top-level val declaration
  - AST validations: Verify no duplicate top-level bindings
- Top-level function declaration
- If-expression
- Function invocation
- String type
- Custom types (other than primitives Int, Dec, Bool, and String)


## Nice-to-haves
- Syntax highlighting plugin for IntelliJ? (Good opportunity to learn about IntelliJ plugins?)
